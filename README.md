Hammerspoon config based on various guides found online.

1. Hammerspoon getting started: [https://www.hammerspoon.org/go/](https://www.hammerspoon.org/go/)
1. Karabiner: [https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) - to make caps key useful (I am using it as hyper key or hotkey prefix)
1. Lua tutorial: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

## what's configured
1. hyper + v: paste things without any formatting
1. wifi watcher to get notification when network changes and displaying the wifi network name in menubar 
1. Global send to omni focus hotkey, hyper + t (task)
1. hyper + 1: open one note
1. hyper + c: open chrome
1. hyper + a: connect airpods (change airpods name in airpods.lua file). If already connected, then take no action. 
1. hyper + d: open selected word in the dictionary app
1. hyper + y: toggle microphone (mute/unmute) and display status in the status bar. Amazon Chime uses command + Y to mute/unmute so "Y" is coming from there. 
1. hyper + h: display cheatsheet of the app (all shortcuts)
